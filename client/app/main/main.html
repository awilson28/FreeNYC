          Like the original <a href="http://freecycle.org">Freecycle.org</a>, Freecycle.nyc aspires to encourage more gifting in order to reduce waste, increase recycling, and strengthen community and good will in NYC. We've upgraded freecycle so that you can check out what's available in your neighborhood at any time of the day, create a wishlist and receive notifications when a posted item matches your keywords, rate your transactions based on gifting ease and delightfulness to discourage no-shows, and exchange messages through the site if you don't want to receive email notifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          With an enhanced UI and a faster and larger database, Freecycle Redux is all about optimizing your gifting experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join and be gifted!
